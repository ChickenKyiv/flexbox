This class is about learning how flexboxes work.
Did you hear about them before?

It's a module, that has roots at Mozilla. It's a big timesaver for Frontend developers.
You'll never want to create an HTML page without flexboxes after this course.

We'll learn only basic things. Specification mostly.

All CSS properties related to flexboxes.
And we'll have a set of easy practical lessons.
For each practice lesson, I advise you to recreate an example from scratch(no copy-paste) by your hands.


Be aware, that this course touching only flexbox basics, so you need to know HTML and CSS.
Check other courses for HTML/CSS basics then



TOOLKIT


Github(https://github.com/) - if you ok to share your code with other - My current pick
Bitbucket(https://bitbucket.org/) - if you want to have a free storage


Google drive(https://www.google.com/drive/)  or Dropbox(https://www.dropbox.com/?landing=dbv2) - if you just want to save your code at cloud


You can also use Codesandbox(https://codesandbox.io) or other online editors.
For practice lessons, I'll use CodePen(http://codepen.io).

But I'm sure - for your project, you'll decide to use a code editor.


Code editors
Sublime(https://www.sublimetext.com/3) - I use it around 6 years. small size and everything important
Atom(https://atom.io/) because it's backed by the GitHub team and it also has a Github sync.


If you want to save your project tasks, you can use Trello(https://trello.com)

If you want to have some flexbox practice, you can check this game: https://flexboxfroggy.com/

Additional materials

Flexbox prefixing
https://autoprefixer.github.io/ (i recommend this option)

Your project is to create a page with recipe cards. Nothing complex, but you need to use flexboxes. Don't use CSS grids or Bootstrap.

It should have a Header, Footer, Navigation(linked to recipe cards at content).With three or more blocks-cards with details about your favorite dishes.

You can use a plain CSS or SASS.

As a code style and "best practice" example you can use SMACSS https://smacss.com/

BUT you restricted to use BEM approach(it's good if you don't know what I'm talking about).

Be cool with your code, use comments, if you want to create easy to understand code structure.


Data

Check this image samples





If you need actual data for your blocks, you can check it at the plugin, that we've built: https://github.com/GroceriStar/groceristar-fetch/blob/master/data/Recipe4/recipe-short-version.json

the main structure of the recipe is(but not limited too)

```
recipe

 - header

   -- title

   -- image

 - description

     -- data

 - ingredients list

   -- data

 - directions list

   -- data
```




You can start to work on your project before finishing the whole course.
I propose you to create a plan, split things into small chunks and move forward by closing this small tasks.





I'll be happy if you do not just complete this project, but go forward and make it better. So take time, generate ideas and experiment. If you want to learn how to code == you should code as much as possible. You can polish this project, while you'll like the code quality.


Please don't worry, if something wouldn't be easy to understand at the first time. Share your process with other students in our Project Directory.  It's much easy to solve problems together!





Additional Assesment(For A+)
0) You can make this page looks better or have additional features, like responsiveness

1) Each recipe in our example has one image. You can create an image gallery.

2)  You can add easing animations, so scrolling(after clicking on top menu) will have cool animation.
