img(src="images/flex-children.png")
<img data-src="img/flex-children.png" style="width:80%;" />
p This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children.



img(src="images/flex-direction-row.png")
<img data-src="img/flex-direction-row.png" style="width:80%;" />
p This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. Think of flex items as primarily laying out either in horizontal rows or vertical columns.


img(src="images/flex-wrap.png")
<img data-src="img/flex-wrap.png" style="width:80%;" />
p By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property.


img(src="images/flex-justify.png")
<img data-src="img/flex-justify.png" style="width:80%;" />
p This defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space left over when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size.


img(src="images/flex-align-items.png")
<img data-src="img/flex-align-items.png" style="width:80%;" />
p This defines the default behaviour for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis on the current line. Think of it as the justify-content version for the cross-axis (perpendicular to the main-axis).



img(src="images/flex-align-content.png")
<img data-src="img/flex-align-content.png" style="width:80%;" />
p This aligns a flex container's lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis, similar to how justify-content aligns individual items within the main-axis.
